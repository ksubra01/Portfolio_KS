# Project 1: [Turtlebot based Face Mask Detection](https://ksubra01.github.io/ksubra.github.io/)  
•	Trained from scratch, a custom convolutional Neural Network architecture having 8 layers, getting 89% testing accuracy.  
•	Collected over 3000 images for training and testing the model. Implemented a secondary CNN for face tracking using MTCNN.  
• Managed 3 custom ROS nodes and 1 custom topic for efficient commnuication.  
• Increased the overall efficiency by reducing deplyoment time by 25%.

# Project 2: [Drone based image processing system for Line following](https://github.com/ksubra01/Line-follower)  
• Drafted, using MATLAB and Simulink, an image processing system with an accuracy of 82.5% for detecting red lines.  
• Modified the flight control system, airframe and model to include edge cases and improve stability by 50%.  
• Deployed PID control to acheive a rise time of 0.34s and overshoot of 6.23%.  

# Project 3: [Vehicle Make and Model Recognition](https://github.com/ksubra01/Make_and_model_Recog)
• Successfully trained and tested a motorvehicle make and model recognition using over 850 images.  
• Acheived a recognition rate of 87.6% for a vocabulary size of 200 and regularization constant of 4.   
• Amongst the various kernels used, an rbf kernel gave the best accuracy for this setting.  
• Significantly increased training time by by 66% reducing the vocabulary size while still preserving accuracy.  

# Project 4: [Traffic light classifier from scratch](https://github.com/ksubra01/Traffic_light_classifier)
• Demonstrated a remarkable 96.6% accuracy on the test dataset.  
• Preprocessed and resized 1484 colored traffic light images to a uniform 32x32 pixel format.  
• Applied one-hot encoding for precise categorization.
