# Portfolio_KS
A short portfolio having details of my projects.

# [Turtlebot based Face Mask Detection](https://ksubra01.github.io/ksubra.github.io/) 
•	Trained from scratch, a custom convolutional Neural Network architecture having 8 layers, getting 89% testing accuracy.
•	Collected over 3000 images for training and testing the model. Implemented a secondary CNN for face tracking using MTCNN.
• Managed 3 custom ROS nodes and 1 custom topic for efficient commnuication.
• Increased the overall efficiency by reduciing deplyoment time by 25%.
