# Portfolio - Karthick Subramanian
A short portfolio having details of my projects.

# Project 1: [Turtlebot based Face Mask Detection](https://ksubra01.github.io/ksubra.github.io/)  
•	Trained from scratch, a custom convolutional Neural Network architecture having 8 layers, getting 89% testing accuracy.  
•	Collected over 3000 images for training and testing the model. Implemented a secondary CNN for face tracking using MTCNN.  
• Managed 3 custom ROS nodes and 1 custom topic for efficient commnuication.  
• Increased the overall efficiency by reducing deplyoment time by 25%.  

Training accuracy:

# Project 2: [Drone based image processing system for Line following](https://github.com/ksubra01/Line-follower)  
• Drafted, using MATLAB and Simulink, an image processing system with an accuracy of 82.5% for detecting red lines.  
• Modified the flight control system, airframe and model to include edge cases and improve stability by 50%.  
• Deployed PID control to acheive a rise time of 0.34s and overshoot of 6.23%.  

# Project 3: [Vehicle Make and Model Recognition using SVM]()
